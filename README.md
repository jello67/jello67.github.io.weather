My project is Weather, a weather app that lets you search for the weather in any location across the world! It shows the date, temperature in Celcius and if it is rainy, snowing, sunny, and more. I made my project to create a fun place to see the weather. I made my project using React and linked to the weather API to get information. I struggled with implementing some of the functionality including getting the API to connect and display information something that was very time consuming to figure out and solve and incorporating new styling elements, a search bar and more. I learned how to make an app using React and style it properly and use the different files found in React Js.
